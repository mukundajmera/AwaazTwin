## What Is Voice Cloning?

Voice cloning uses artificial intelligence to learn the unique characteristics of a person's voice — including pitch, tone, cadence, and accent — and then generate new speech that sounds like that person. AwaazTwin makes this process accessible through a browser-based interface that runs entirely on your local machine, no cloud services required.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following ready. You need a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge), Node.js 18 or later installed on your machine, and a microphone or a set of pre-recorded audio samples in WAV or MP3 format. At least 30 seconds of clean speech is recommended for a basic clone; longer samples will improve quality. AwaazTwin is designed to run on CPU-only hardware, so a dedicated GPU is not required.

## Getting Started Steps

Start by launching the AwaazTwin portal and navigating to the **Voice Cloning** section from the sidebar. Upload your audio samples or record directly in the browser using the built-in recorder. Once your samples are uploaded, the system will preprocess and analyze the audio. You can then select a base model, configure basic parameters like language and speaking rate, and generate your first cloned speech output. Review the result in the playback panel and iterate by adjusting settings or adding more training data.
