## Preparing Your Audio

Start by gathering a clean audio sample of the voice you want to clone. Aim for at least 30 seconds of uninterrupted speech with minimal background noise. You can use the built-in recorder in the AwaazTwin portal — just navigate to **Voice Cloning → Record**, grant microphone access, and read the provided sample script. If you already have a recording, click **Upload** and select a WAV or MP3 file from your computer.

## Creating the Clone

Once your audio is uploaded, the portal will display a waveform preview and run automatic preprocessing to trim silence and normalize volume. Select a base model (XTTS v2 is recommended for beginners), choose your target language, and click **Create Clone**. The processing takes a few minutes on CPU hardware. You can monitor progress in real time via the status bar. When complete, your new voice profile will appear in the **My Voices** panel.

## Testing and Iterating

With your voice clone ready, head to the **Playground** page. Type any text into the input field, select your newly created voice from the dropdown, and click **Synthesize**. Listen to the output and evaluate the quality. If the result does not sound quite right, try providing additional audio samples or adjusting parameters like temperature and repetition penalty. Each iteration helps you understand how different inputs and settings affect the final output.
