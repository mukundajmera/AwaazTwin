## Why Preprocessing Matters

Raw audio recordings almost always contain artifacts that degrade voice cloning and TTS quality. Preprocessing transforms raw audio into a clean, normalized signal that models can learn from effectively. Skipping this step is the most common cause of poor clone quality in beginner workflows.

## The Preprocessing Pipeline

### Step 1: Format Conversion

Ensure all audio is in a consistent format. AwaazTwin expects WAV files at 22050 Hz sample rate, 16-bit depth, mono channel. The portal automatically converts uploaded files, but understanding the target format helps when troubleshooting quality issues.

### Step 2: Silence Trimming

Remove leading and trailing silence from recordings. Long silences waste processing time and can confuse models. AwaazTwin uses energy-based voice activity detection to automatically trim silence to 200ms padding on each end.

### Step 3: Volume Normalization

Normalize the audio to a consistent peak level (typically -1 dBFS). This ensures the model sees consistent amplitude patterns regardless of the original recording volume. Peak normalization is preferred over loudness normalization for voice cloning inputs.

### Step 4: Noise Reduction

Apply spectral gating or adaptive filtering to remove background noise. See the dedicated Noise Reduction guide for detailed techniques and trade-offs.

### Step 5: Quality Validation

After preprocessing, validate the output: check the signal-to-noise ratio (target >20 dB), verify speech is still natural-sounding, and ensure no clipping or distortion was introduced.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Over-normalizing**: Applying both peak and loudness normalization can squash dynamic range, making speech sound flat.
- **Wrong sample rate**: Resampling without proper anti-aliasing filters introduces high-frequency artifacts.
- **Skipping validation**: Always listen to preprocessed audio before feeding it to models.
